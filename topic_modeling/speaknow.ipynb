Tell me, how's your family? I haven't seen them in a while You've been good, busier than ever We small talk, work and the weather Your guard is up and I know why Because the last time you saw me Is still burned in the back of your mind You gave me roses, and I left them there to die So this is me swallowing my pride Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night And I go back to December all the time It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright I go back to December all the time These days, I haven't been sleeping Staying up, playing back myself leaving When your birthday passed and I didn't call And I think about summer, all the beautiful times I watched you laughing from the passenger side and Realized I loved you in the fall And then the cold came The dark days when fear crept into my mind You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye So this is me swallowing my pride Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night And I go back to December all the time It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind I go back to December all the time I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile So good to me, so right And how you held me in your arms that September night The first time you ever saw me cry Maybe this is wishful thinking Probably mindless dreaming But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't So if the chain is on your door, I understand But this is me swallowing my pride Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night And I go back to December It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind I go back to December all the time All the time  \n",

The girl in the dress cried the whole way home I shoulda known Well, maybe it's me And my blind optimism to blame Or maybe it's you and your sick need To give love and take it away And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors Who don't understand And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said \"Run as fast as you can\" Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress cried the whole way home Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong Don't you think nineteen's too young To be played by your dark, twisted games When I loved you so? I shoulda known You are an expert at sorry And keeping lines blurry Never impressed by me acing your tests All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes 'Cause you burned them out But I took your matches Before fire could catch me So don't look now I'm shining like fireworks Over your sad empty town, yeah Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress cried the whole way home I see it all now that you're gone Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? The girl in the dress wrote you a song You shoulda known You shoulda known Don't you think I was too young? You shoulda known  \n",

(Live Performance) | Open Mic Kiana LedÃ© 'Ur Best Friend' Official Lyrics & Meaning | Verified Kiana LedÃ© 'Ur Best Friend' Official Lyrics & Meaning | Verified The lingering question kept me up 2AM, who do you love? I wonder 'til I'm wide awake And now I'm pacing back and forth Wishing you were at my door I'd open up and you would say, \"Hey\" It was enchanting to meet you All I know is I was enchanted to meet you This night is sparkling Don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck Blushing all the way home I'll spend forever Wondering if you knew This night is flawless Don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck Dancing around all alone I'll spend forever Wondering if you knew I was enchanted to meet you This is me praying that This was the very first page Not where the storyline ends My thoughts will echo your name Until I see you again These are the words I held back As I was leaving too soon I was enchanted to meet you Please don't be in love With someone else Please don't have somebody Waiting on you Please don't be in love (Ooh) With someone else Please don't have somebody (Ooh, hey) Waiting on you This night is sparkling Don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck Blushing all the way home I'll spend forever Wondering if you knew This night is flawless (Please don't be in love with someone else) Don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck (Please don't have somebody waiting on you) Dancing around all alone I'll spend forever (Please don't be in love with someone else) Wondering if you knew I was enchanted to meet you Please don't be in love With someone else Please don't have somebody Waiting on you  \n",
