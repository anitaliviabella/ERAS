       "0  I forget how the West was won I forget if this was ever fun I just learned these people only raise you to cage you Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best Clutching their pearls, sighing, \"What a mess\" I just learned these people try and save you Cause they hate you Too high a horse For a simple girl to rise above it They slammed the door on my whole world The one thing I wanted Now I'm running with my dress unbuttoned Screaming, \"But Daddy, I love him! I'm having his baby\" No, I'm not, but you should see your faces I'm telling him to floor it through the fences No, I'm not coming to my senses I know he's crazy but he's the one I want Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid Tendrils tucked into a woven braid Growing up precocious sometimes means not growing up at all He was chaos, he was revelry Bedroom eyes like a remedy Soon enough the elders had convened Down at the city hall \"Stay away from her\" The saboteurs protested too much Lord knows the words we never heard Just screeching tires and true love And I'm running with my dress unbuttoned Screaming, \"But Daddy, I love him! I'm having his baby\" No, I'm not, but you should see your faces I'm telling him to floor it through the fences No, I'm not coming to my senses I know he's crazy but he's the one I want I'll tell you something right now I'd rather burn my whole life down Than listen to one more second of all this bitching and moaning I'll tell you something about my good name It's mine alone to disgrace I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing God save the most judgmental creeps Who say they want what's best for me Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see Thinking it can change the beat Of my heart when he touches me And counteract the chemistry And undo the destiny You ain't gotta pray for me Me and my wild boy and all this wild joy If all you want is gray for me Then it's just white noise And it's just my choice There's a lot of people in town that I Bestow upon my fakest smiles Scandal does funny things to pride But brings lovers closer We came back when the heat died down Went to my parents and they came around All the wine moms are still holding out But fuck 'em, it's over Now I'm dancing in my dress in the sun, and Even my daddy just loves him I'm his lady And oh my God, you should see your faces Time, doesn't it give some perspective? And no, you can't come to the wedding I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want I'll tell you something right now, you ain't gotta pray for me Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy He was chaos, he was revelry If all you want is gray for me Then it's just white noise, and it's my choice Screaming, \"But Daddy, I love him! I'm having his baby\" No, I'm not, but you Should see your faces But oh my God, you should see your faces He was chaos, he was revelry  \n",

I was in my tower weaving nightmares Twisting all my smiles into snarls They say what doesn't kill you makes you aware What happens if it becomes who you are? So they killed Cassandra first Cause she feared the worst And tried to tell the town So they set my life in flames, I regret to say Do you believe me now? They knew, they knew, they knew the whole time That I was onto somethin' The family, the pure greed, the Christian chorus line They all said nothin' Blood's thick, but nothin' like a payroll Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul You can mark my words that I said it first In a mourning warning no one heard I patched up the crack along the wall I pass it and lose track of what I'm saying Cause that's where I was when I lost it all So they killed Cassandra first Cause she feared the worst And tried to tell the town So they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say Do you believe me now? I was onto somethin' They all said nothin' Blood's thick, but nothin' like a payroll Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul You can mark my words that I said it first In a mourning warning no one heard No one heard Not a single word was heard When the first stone's thrown there's screamin' In the streets there's a ragin' riot When it's \"Burn the bitch\", they're shriekin' When the truth comes out it's quiet It's so quiet  \n",

Like it never happened Could it be enough to just float in your orbit? Can we watch our phantoms like watching wild horses? Cooler in theory, but not if you force it To be, it just didn't happen So if you want to break my cold, cold heart Say you loved me And if you want to tear my world apart Say you'll always wonder Cause I wonder Will I always Will I always wonder?  \n",
